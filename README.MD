Uniformed Cost Search
Implementation of BFS, DFS and UCS searches in AI.
Currently works for about 10/100 Test Cases. 

Known bugs:
1. Can go into stack overflow if the recursion is called for large depths. (needs to be fixed)
2. Input format must be given as is (changes in input pattern with loops detection has to be fixed)
